        <h1><b>Rugby Union</b></h1>
        <br>
        <h3>History of rugby</h3>
        <p>A commemorative stone in a rugby school in Warwickshire, England, claims that 16-year-old William Webb Ellis invented the game of rugby.
           Rugby eventually split into two different sports in 1895 when twenty one clubs separated from the Rugby Football Union to form Rugby League.
           Rugby league led the charge in professionalising the game of rugby, while rugby union didn't follow suit until 1995.
           Both American and Canadian football evolved from rugby.</p>

        <h3>Ireland's recent success in rugby</h3>
        <p>Ireland and recently jumped up to number two in the world for the first time in rugby history.
           To add to this success in 2018 they won a summer series in Australia for the first time ever
           and beat the All Blacks at home making it the second victory over the number one ranking team in the world.
           Ireland are the current holders of the six nation trophy after winning the grand slam last season.
           Despite all their success there remains question marks surrounding Ireland's ability to achieve in the world cup.
           Ireland still haven't gone beyond quarter final stages of the world cup. 
           Having said that if there was ever a time to believe that Ireland are capable of going past quarter final stages,
           this years RWC in Japan would seem the most likely.</p>

        <h3>My rugby career</h3>
        <p>I have played rugby since I was 7 years-of-age. I started playing with my local club all the way up through the age groups.
           I'm currently playing with UCC Rugby which we'ev gotten through to the Donal Walsh final.
           I've found rugby to be a great way of making new friends and meeting new people, especially since I'ev come to college. 
           Rugby is becoming more and more physically demanding which means playing it has required me to maintain a high
           level of fitness.</p>
